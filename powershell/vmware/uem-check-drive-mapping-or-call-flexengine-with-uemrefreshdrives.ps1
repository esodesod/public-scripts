# PowerShell script to check if N: drive exists, else run FlexEngine with UemRefreshDrives
# Useful for delayed network sessions (e.g. slow access / VLAN switching, etc.)
# * If exists, exit script.
# * If not exist, call FlexEngine.exe with -UemRefreshDrives, and sleep N seconds.
# * Retry commands N times, before exiting.
